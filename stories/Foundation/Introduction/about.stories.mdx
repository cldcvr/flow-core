# Welcome to Flow ðŸŽ‰

<br />
<br />

## What is Flow?

<f-divider></f-divider>

A design system that consists of principles, patterns, guidelines, and processes to enable design at scale; without compromising on the developer experience and design standards of CloudCover.

## Key Features

<br />

### Framework Agnostic

<f-divider></f-divider>

Flow works on any HTML or JS script based frameworks.{" "}

### Obvious

<f-divider></f-divider>

Everything we build and design needs to be simple, intuitive, and obvious to anyone using the framework. This includes naming conventions, props and values definitions, documentation, etc.

### Figma â†’ Front-end

<f-divider></f-divider>

<p>
  Everything you see in Flow from a front-end implementation POV has to exist in Figma. The Figma
  component properties or template layouts have to be the same for the developer experience.
  <br />
  <br />
  If you are a developer with a new contribution to Flow and do not have Figma experience/skills, you
  can write into <a href="https://flow.cldcvr.com/" target="blank">
    flow@cldcvr.com
  </a> and someone from the CloudCoverâ€™s design team will get in touch with you. Keep in mind that the
  designers are actively engaged into other products and a response/implementation might take a little
  time.
</p>

### Dependencies

<f-divider></f-divider>

<p>
  To keep everything lean and customizable, any new features should be created as dependencies to
  avoid bloat at the Flow core level. This allows for features to live on different streams and
  continuously develop/update without affecting the main core.
